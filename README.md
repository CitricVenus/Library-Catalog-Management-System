Project Overview:

Create a Library Catalog Management System in Java that utilizes Collections for creating data, reading data, and updating data to work with the Library Catalog Management System. This system will empower librarians to manage book details, track availability, and perform various catalog-related operations.

Book Class:

    Develop a Book class with attributes such as book ID, title, author, genre, and availability status.

User Interface:

    Design a simple command-line interface for users to interact with the system.
    Include options to add new books, view existing book details, check availability, and perform other catalog-related operations.

Data Validation:

    Implement validation checks to ensure the accuracy of entered data (e.g., valid book ID format, proper genre categorization).
    Handle user inputs with clear error messages.

Collections Mastery:

    Attain proficiency in working with collections.
    Implement effective exception handling for file-related operations.

User Interaction:

    Develop a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the Library Catalog Management System.
    Ensure user inputs are handled gracefully, providing clear feedback.

Data Integrity:

    Enforce data validation to maintain the integrity of book records.
    Implement error handling for invalid inputs.
